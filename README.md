# Luhn-algorithm
Build a production-grade ASP.NET Web API with a single REST action: The ability to
 take a credit card number and perform luhn validation on that number. The API end point will
 return a boolean value-true if the credit card number is valid accordingto
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

 Code it as professionally as you would in a paid job. This shouldn’t take more than an hour,
 but examples of what we want to see beyond just code that work sare:
 ●Appropriate documentation
 ●Errorhandling
